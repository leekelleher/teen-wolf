## Finding Contentment

### The Session

Contentment is a multi-award winning Umbraco package, but why? If you haven't heard of the package, or unsure what it does, or plain old just haven't tried it out yet, let Lee "x12 MVP" Kelleher, give you a grand tour of its property-editors and key features, all helping you deliver the most delightful CMS backoffice experience for your content authors.

### The Speaker

Lee has been working with Umbraco CMS since 2007, yes - this is a long time in technology, I guess he loves the code, ecosystem and community.

### The Slides

There were no slides for this session. The entire demonstration happened in the Umbraco CMS backoffice.

### Video

A recording of this session is available on Umbraco's YouTube channel.

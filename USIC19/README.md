## Don't lose your head!
### The State of Decoupling Umbraco in 2019

Today, we have a variety of options for architecting our Umbraco solutions, from the traditional single-server approach housing both website front-end and CMS back-end, to the trending approach of separating concerns by decoupling the front-end from the back-end, a la headless.

How do you decide which is the best for your next Umbraco project? Whether that would be a regular website, multi-tenancy website, mobile app, chat-bots, kiosks, voice skills, or a combination of any of those.

Together we’ll explore the benefits of these approaches and help you make an informed decision whether to choose between traditional, hybrid and headless, based on your project’s requirements, developer skill-set, editorial needs and future-proofing.

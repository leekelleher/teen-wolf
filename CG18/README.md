## Applying Atomic Design to Umbraco

<https://codegarden18.com/sessions/applying-atomic-design-to-umbraco/>


### The Session

Lee and Marc have been brought together and challenged to dismantle the art of designing great Umbraco Backoffice Content Management structures through the trendy vernacular of Atomic Design.

Style guides, design systems, and pattern libraries are rapidly becoming common ground in the fast-moving world of front-end web development.

How does this relate to your friendly CMS? Can we take the principles of "atomic design" - a methodology for crafting robust modular design systems - and apply this to your own Umbraco Backoffice implementations.

Is it time to ditch your trusty starter kit, and break things down a bit more? Have the front-end cool kids got a point?

This session will guide you through the concepts of atomic design, adopting a pattern-based ‘scientific’ process to establish a better workflow, creating a shared vocabulary for your team, and leading to simpler, easier to maintain, astonishingly neat Umbraco implementations.

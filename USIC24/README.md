## Bellissima migrazione dei pacchetti
**Beautiful package migration**

### The Session

Bellissima is on the horizon, the Umbraco 14 release draws near, everyone is eager to try it out, and everyone is eager for their favourite packages to support it, no pressure then. Whether you are a package developer or have developed extensions for your own company solutions, you may currently feel there are many unknowns with the new CMS backoffice. Fear not, Lee has braved such unknowns with his own package migration journey and will offer you practical guidance and tips on how to begin migrating your custom dashboards and property-editors from AngularJS to the new Web Components driven UI.

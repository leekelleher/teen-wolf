## The Road to Contentment
**Making of a Killer Umbraco Package**

or **Confessions of a Serial Umbraco Package Developer**

or **The Virtue of Accepting the Banality and Sense of Entitlement in Open Source**

### The Session

At CodeGarden 2015, Lee gave a session called ["How to Develop a Killer Package"](../CG15) - exploring the history of Umbraco package development, from the basics through to advanced concepts and best practices.

Now in 2020, Lee will explore if these principles are still valid and how he attempted to apply those to his upcoming Umbraco package... **Contentment**!

This session will provide a first-look in-depth tour of the property-editors and features in Lee's new **Contentment** package.

### The Speaker

Lee has been building with Umbraco for over 12 years, he has contributed to and developed many packages, (including the mighty **uComponents**), as well as being awarded Umbraco MVP status a whopping 9 times! Lee co-founded [Umbrella, an Umbraco consultancy agency](https://umbrellainc.co.uk/), delivering technical solutions for clients such as Carlsberg, Jaguar, ITN and Microsoft.

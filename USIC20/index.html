                    Cast your mind back 12 months ago...<br />
                    For those what did see my talk at Spark last year - it went okay, had good feedback, (folks said it was interesting, good insights),<br />
                    but by god, I bored myself with it! I recall one point mid-talk where I was thinking what's the point of this?<br />
                    This had nothing to do the event itself, it was my own fault for picking a topic that didn't come from my heart.<br />
                    It wasn't personal enough.

                    I was still coming to terms that Carlsberg outsourced the support contract that we'd been doing for the previous 5 years, it was a big a corporation-wide swoop of all their IT projects.<br />
                    We wanted another high profile international brand, which we found and was pitching for. Timings wise the final pitch was on the following Tuesday after Spark, which would have seen us good for the next year or so - and kept our client list high profile.<br />
                    Was pretty stressed about that (during Spark). We didn't win the pitch, (we were told we came a close second), which knocked me off my feet.

                    In retrospect, I'd done the same with uComponents when Umbraco v7 came out.<br />
                    I'd even wrote a 24 Days article about this very thing!<br />
                    Expectation is the mother of all frustration.

                    Back on my day-to-day at Umbrella. We started to get a lot of enquiries about brownfield projects - clients who ended up in a bad relationship with their agency<br />

                    It's funny how many Umbraco sites suffer with performance from the dreaded `.Descendants()` API, well that, and dynamics!<br />
                    Another funny thing is how many of these sites were using packages that I'd built (or contributed to).<br />

                    But what I found from working on several brownfield sites, I started to get bored (technically), I was stuck on v7! No v8 for me!

                    All I knew about v8 was the 3 big marketing features - not much else.<br />
                    I wanted to know more. I was curious what the differences were from v7 (from a package perspective).<br />
                    So I dabbled with it between support tickets.

                    But I hated it! Felt so contrived, so forced!<br />
                    I wouldn't have felt happy to release it and support it.<br />

                    I needed to do something that didn't put pressure on myself, so I looked at my past to determine my future.

                    I went back to my uComponents roots... I took a look at some of the simpler Property Editors that we had, that no one else appeared to have modernised.  I recalled one called RenderMacro, which was a readonly editor, that rendered a macro in the backoffice to appear as an instructional/editorial note - or a breadcrumb trail.<br />

                    It was cathartic.

                        then prototyped how that would work in v8.
                        Then making Render Macro, meant that I needed a Macro Picker
                        so I looked around the Umbraco core source to see what I could find...
                        no property editor as such, there was a Macro Picker for TinyMCE, and one for a Grid Editor, and another for the Template editor...
                        but not property-editor, the overlay was there, just the UI editor was missing.

                        now the Macro could be selected and configured.
                        But then the Macro Picker would need a way to restrict the available Macros...
                        so use the Macro Picker inside itself

                        but wait, no, this wasn't a way to configure a Macro (with parameters),
                        I just wanted to reference the Macro, (say by UDI), so it was really an Entity Picker that was needed...
                        so I made that. Where the Entity Picker could be configured to select from different Umbraco entity types.

                        I found the `entityResource` API, where you could pass through the `entityType`.

                        I found the Umbraco "entitypicker" which was a dropdown, with multi-select option ... it wasn't very slick, wasn't very "v8".

                    <aside class="notes">
                        At this point, I had wrangled the Item Picker overlay (from Umbraco), that I could populate it with whatever I wanted...
                        (as long as the item had a name/value/icon/description), then we could have a picker for anything. So I made it extensible...
                        having various data sources - Enum, SQL, XML, JSON, Umbraco entities - and it was pluggable too!
                        ...
                        But wait, if I made the data source extensible - why not the editor UI?
                        Why have a separate Property Editor if I wanted to populate, say, a checkbox list or dropdown list or radiobutton list from one of those data sources? So I made that extensible too - and Data List was born.

                        Oh no, I'd killed nuPickers!<br />
                        eek, love you Hendy!

                        but looking back over my uComponents ideas, there was an idea for Data List that pre-dated nuPickers
                        with the involvement of Hendy, Tom Fulton, et al.

                    <aside class="notes">
                        In making Data List, the component that powered the custom data source / list editor provider became its own thing� Configuration Editor. Give it list of C# classes (of a common interface) and it would open an overlay editor with those `ConfigurationField` options.

                        In prototyping some of the data sources, other Property Editors were created. E.g. with the Enum data source, I needed an interface that would cascade a selected value, e.g. an assembly name, to the next interface, to select the enum type. I made this as a series of dropdown lists� Cascading Dropdown List editor became a thing - provide a list of API endpoints, which will call the next endpoint with the selected value(s).

## Finding Contentment

### The Session

<https://day.umbraco.community/sessions/finding-contentment>

Contentment is a multi-award winning Umbraco package, but why? If you haven't heard of the package, or unsure what it does, or plain old just haven't tried it out yet, let me, Lee "x12 MVP" Kelleher, give you a whistle-stop tour of its property-editors and features.

### The Speaker

<https://day.umbraco.community/speakers/lee-kelleher/>

Lee has been working with Umbraco CMS since 2007, yes - this is a long time in technology, I guess he loves the code, ecosystem and community.

### The Slides

There were no slides for this session. The entire demonstration happened in the Umbraco CMS backoffice.

### Video

A recording of all the Umbraco Community Day sessions is available on YouTube.

The _Finding Contentment_ session begins around the 2 hour mark: <https://youtu.be/HcwH_Fu-PQ0?t=7347>

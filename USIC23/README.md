## Playmaker: Dances with Wolves
**Productising an Umbraco solution**

### The Session

[Gibe Digital](https://gibe.digital/) manage several high profile football club websites, at scale and success. When it comes to enquiries from clubs in lower divisions or different sports however, costs are often prohibitive. The answer was simple, why not productise the best parts of these Umbraco solutions, making the features to be generic and reusable, reducing overall upfront costs? Playmaker was born.

In this session, Lee and Luke will show you how this was achieved using Wolverhampton Wanderers football club as our Playmaker pioneer; migrating content from Umbraco 7 to the latest version, delivering a delightful CMS backoffice experience, along with pluggable integrations for 3rd party services offering eCommerce, single sign on, game statistics and live streaming video.
